# Welcome to Technical Scratches

Hi, I'm **Dan Marshall**, a passionate software engineer with over a decade of experience building clean, tested, and sustainable software. This blog is where I share my thoughts on software engineering, development practices, and life as a developer.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Technical insights** from real-world development experiences
- **Best practices** in software engineering and architecture  
- **Lessons learned** from working across diverse domains and technologies
- **Thoughts on craftsmanship** and the art of writing maintainable code
- **Personal reflections** on growth, mentorship, and giving back to the community

## My Philosophy

I believe in the principles outlined in *The Clean Coder* by Robert C. Martin and embrace the values of the Agile Manifesto. I'm committed to:

- Writing self-documenting, rigorously tested code
- Continuous learning and improvement
- Mentoring others and fostering growth
- Building software that stands the test of time
