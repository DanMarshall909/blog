# Dan Marshall – Developer Profile

With over a decade of experience in software engineering across diverse domains, I am a passionate and confident developer committed to building clean, self-documenting, rigorously tested, and sustainable software. I take _The Clean Coder_ by Robert C. Martin as my professional code of conduct and deeply value the principles of the Agile Manifesto.

Known for my approachable nature and positive energy, I genuinely enjoy listening, sharing insights, and helping others grow. Mentorship comes naturally to me—I take pride in creating an environment where others can thrive, and I celebrate when a mentee surpasses me. This industry has given me so much, and I’m driven by a strong desire to give back.
