<p>If you work with financial data, you will run into the situation where you need to round calculated values to the nearest<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>cent.</p>
<p>If you round up in every case, then that may work internally, but if your accounting package works otherwise (<strong>it will</strong>), and the other side of the ledger comes from somewhere other than your code, you may well have values that donâ€™t balance exactlyâ€”which is critical for accounting<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>purposes. </p>
<p>So itâ€™s important to have these rounding algorithms in sync, or youâ€™ll run into an <strong>angry accountant</strong>. Given the number of transactions that occur daily in most systems, this will pop up often if it doesnâ€™t get done<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>right.</p>
<h2 id="different-rounding-methods"><strong>Different Rounding Methods</strong></h2>
<p>There are many possible ways to calculate rounding when you have a difference of exactly <strong>$0.005</strong>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Rounding_half_to_even">See wikipedia</a>. </p>
<p>Do you round up to <strong>1c</strong>, or down to <strong>0c</strong>? Note that this isnâ€™t an issue for <strong>$0.0051</strong>, which is closer to <strong>1c</strong>. Itâ€™s only for <strong>exact amounts ending in 5</strong> as the third significant<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>digit.</p>
<h2 id="bankers-rounding-the-standard-in-finance"><strong>Bankers Rounding - The Standard in<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Finance</strong></h2>
<p>Thankfully, a convention has arisen in the financial world called <strong>Bankers Rounding</strong>. This is the <strong>default rounding mode in C#</strong> for <code>decimal</code>, but it <strong>can be overridden</strong> by choosing a different midpoint rounding<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>mode. </p>
<p>Iâ€™ve seen this done a lot, <strong>often for no good reason.</strong><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>ðŸ˜¬</p>
<h3 id="how-bankers-rounding-works"><strong>How Bankers Rounding<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Works</strong></h3>
<p>Bankers Rounding rounds every amount <strong>up or down to the nearest <span class="caps">EVEN</span><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>cent</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="example-1-rounding-up"><strong>Example 1 - Rounding<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Up</strong></h3>
<p>Consider <strong>$0.555</strong>, which has two <span class="caps">EVEN</span> cents on either<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>side:</p>
<p>$0.54 (difference of 1.5c) â†’ rounding down. $0.555 $0.56 (difference of 0.5c) â†’ rounding<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>up.</p>
<p>Since <strong>0.5 &lt; 1.5</strong>, we round<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>up.</p>
<p><strong>$0.555 â†’ $0.56</strong></p>
<h3 id="example-2-rounding-down"><strong>Example 2 - Rounding<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Down</strong></h3>
<p>Consider <strong>$0.565</strong>, which also has two <span class="caps">EVEN</span> cents on either<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>side:</p>
<p>$0.56 (difference of 0.5c) â†’ rounding down. $0.565 $0.58 (difference of 1.5c) â†’ rounding<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>up.</p>
<p>Since <strong>0.5 &lt; 1.5</strong>, we round<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>up.</p>
<p><strong>$0.565 â†’ $0.56</strong></p>

<h2 id="best-practice-use-a-financial-math-library"><strong>Best Practice: Use a Financial Math<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Library</strong></h2>
<p>To prevent issues, <strong>create an organization-wide Financial Math library</strong> that includes a rounding method like<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>this:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>`csharp
public static decimal UsingBankersRoundingToNearestCent(this decimal amount) 
    =&gt; Math.Round(amount, 2, MidpointRounding.ToEven);
And enforce its usage across your<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>codebase.</p>
<p>Even better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a linting rule to detect any usage of Math.Round() and flag it as an<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>error.</li>
<li>Require explicit overrides when necessary, ensuring no unexpected rounding bugs creep<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>in.</li>
</ul>
